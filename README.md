##Weather Data
The weather data format selected for this project is based on OpenWeather (https://openweathermap.org/), 
which offers weather data freely for developers. Data for Benguerir, Rabat, and Casablanca are preloaded for testing purposes, eliminating the need for API usage.

##Conversation Flow
The conversation begins with the end-user's input. A greeting or goodbye message should reset any previous assumptions or collected knowledge by the bot. 
If the query does not specify time or weather details, the bot will provide current and generic weather conditions. When the city is not specified in the query, 
the bot will prompt the user to provide it. Any further details in the query will be answered with more specific information if available.
